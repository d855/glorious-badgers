### Routes

All Laravel routes are defined in your route files, which are located in the routes directory. These files are
automatically loaded by your application's App\Providers\RouteServiceProvider. The routes/web.php file defines routes
that are for your web interface.

### Views

You may create a view by placing a file with the .blade.php extension in your application's resources/views directory.
The .blade.php extension informs the framework that the file contains a Blade template. Blade templates contain HTML as
well as Blade directives that allow you to easily echo values, create "if" statements, iterate over data, and more.
